# Towards user-driven earth observation-based slum mapping
This repository contains all the jupyter notebooks and R used for mapping and change detection case study in Accra, Ghana. 

## Rationale 
Remote sensing capabilities to produced up-to-date spatial information on slums over large areas to support urban planning and evidence-based policiymaking is largely acknowledged. Mapping to meet user expectation remains a challenge. This study combines end-user requirements, geoethics and local contextual knowledge to model and map slums/deprived areas. the proposed framework is shown in fig 1.

## Getting started 
These instructions will help to replicate the processing chain

## Required software and packages 
The work required on free and open-source software and packages for geospatial proessig and analysis. **GRASS GIS** was integrated and implemented in jupyter notebook. It use mainly used for raster processing. **PostgreSQl with PostGIs** extension was used for storing managing and processing laege vector datasets. Additionally, **Python and R** were used for machine learning. Packages include **sklearn, pandas, numpy**
